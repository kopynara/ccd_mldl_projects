        { key: "crossValidation", title: "교차 검증 (Cross-validation)", prompt: "A clear and simple diagram illustrating K-fold cross-validation. Show a dataset split into multiple folds. One fold is highlighted as the test set, while the others are the training set. Arrows show this process repeating with a different fold as the test set each time. Use clean, geometric shapes and labels like 'Train' and 'Test'." },
        { key: "overfittingUnderfitting", title: "과대적합 vs 과소적합 (Overfitting vs Underfitting)", prompt: "A graph with data points and three different lines. One line is too simple (a straight line) and doesn't fit the points well (underfitting). Another line is a perfect, smooth curve that fits the data well (good fit). The third line is a very complex, jagged line that passes through every single data point, including noise (overfitting). Use distinct colors for each line and labels like 'Underfitting', 'Good Fit', and 'Overfitting'." },
        { key: "dataPreprocessing", title: "데이터 전처리 (Data Preprocessing)", prompt: "A before-and-after diagram showing data preprocessing. The 'Before' side shows a messy, noisy dataset with missing values. The 'After' side shows a clean, organized dataset with all values filled and standardized. Use simple icons like a messy pile of blocks for 'Before' and a neat stack of blocks for 'After'." },
        { key: "decisionTree", title: "결정 트리 (Decision Tree)", prompt: "A visual metaphor of a decision tree as a simple, upright tree diagram. Start with a root node at the top, branching out to internal nodes that represent decisions or questions. The branches lead to leaf nodes at the bottom, which represent final classifications or outcomes. Use icons like question marks for decision nodes and simple symbols for leaf nodes." },
        { key: "randomForest", title: "랜덤 포레스트 (Random Forest)", prompt: "A simple illustration of a random forest. Show multiple, independent decision trees side-by-side, each making a different prediction. Then, show a final outcome determined by combining the predictions of all the individual trees, like a voting process. Use a title 'Random Forest' and labels for 'Tree 1', 'Tree 2', etc., leading to a final 'Majority Vote'." },
        { key: "linearRegression", title: "선형 회귀 (Linear Regression)", prompt: "A 2D scatter plot with a clear, straight line passing through the center of the data points. The line should represent the best fit for the data. Use labels for the X and Y axes and the line, such as 'Linear Regression Line'." },
        { key: "logisticRegression", title: "로지스틱 회귀 (Logistic Regression)", prompt: "A 2D scatter plot showing data points belonging to two different classes, separated by an S-shaped curve (sigmoid function).
